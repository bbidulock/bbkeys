-[  README for bbkeys, a general XWindow keygrabber, meant to be a working
-[  example of a better window-hinting scheme with blackbox.

    Check out NEWS for more information....

    This is the brave new world of bbkeys, the next generation.  The first
    bbkeys (through 0.8.6) had gotten big and out of control, code-wise.
    It was the first C++ code I'd ever written and it showed.  Then along
    came openbox and woodblock's simple and elegant epist keygrabber was
    beefed up big-time, and now it's known as epist-ng, and it's
    distributed with openbox2.

    Wellsir, bbkeys either needed a complete rewrite or project
    abandonment.  I chose the former.  Time will tell as to the wisdom of
    that.  Bbkeys now supports a much more flexible configuration file.  It
    more accurately represents the config file as a tree object, which it
    is.  It also shares blackbox's menu-file's structure, so hopefully
    blackbox and bbkeys will be able to share common file-parser code.

    Bbkeys 0.8.6 and before was never designed for parameters in the
    config-file, nor was it able to handle chained keybindings.  I
    personally never used emacs before a few months ago, but since I've
    started using it, I completely understand how valuable it is--and how
    some users do need chained keybindings (ya just run out of them with
    emacs).  So, this next generation of bbkeys will allow for both chained
    keybindings and parameterized keybindings.

    The other neato thing that's coming out of this bbkeys complete
    overhaul is the fact that it will be sharing code for the first time
    with blackbox proper!!  This is EXTREMELY good news, and is the best
    thing to happen to blackbox since sliced bread!

-[  A note on the config file....

    Previously, bbkeys kept its config options and its keybinding
    definition file in two separate places.  This was yucky and wasteful
    and was only done because I didn't think 2 seconds about it before now.
    But learning from mistakes (and learning from others' good code) is a
    Good Thing (TM).  Thus, bbkeys's config-file has changed.  It resembles
    blackbox's menu-file structure, as shown below....

[begin] (bbkeys configuration file)

  [config]
    [option] (honorModifiers) {false}
    [option] (stackedCycling) {true}
    [option] (stackedRaise) {false}
    [option] (showCycleMenu)  {true}
    [option] (menuTextJustify) {right}
    [option] (autoConfig)   {true}
    [option] (autoConfigCheckTimeout) {10}
    [option] (workspaceColumns) {4}
    [option] (workspaceRows) {2}
  [end]

  [keybindings] (begin keybindings)
    [chain] (Mod1-Y)
      [execute] (1) {xmms}
      [execute] (2) {aumix -v +5}
      [execute] (3) {aumix -v -5}
    [end]
    [Lower]  (Mod1-Down)
    [Raise]  (Mod1-Up)
    [toggleShade]  (Mod1-F9)
    [Close]  (Mod1-F4)
    [Iconify]  (Mod1-M)
    [toggleMaximizeFull]  (Mod1-F12)
    [toggleMaximizeHorizontal]  (Mod1-F11)
    [toggleMaximizeVertical]  (Mod1-F10)
    [toggleOmnipresent]  (Mod1-Control-S)
    [toggleDecorations]  (Mod1-Control-T)
    [resizeWindowWidth]  (Mod1-Control-Shift-Left) {-5}
    [resizeWindowWidth]  (Mod1-Control-Shift-Right) {5}
    [resizeWindowHeight]  (Mod1-Control-Shift-Up) {-5}
    [resizeWindowHeight]  (Mod1-Control-Shift-Down) {5}
    [moveWindowUp]  (Mod1-Control-Up) 
    [moveWindowDown]  (Mod1-Control-Down)
    [moveWindowLeft]  (Mod1-Control-Left)
    [moveWindowRight]  (Mod1-Control-Right)
    [NextWindow]  (Mod1-Tab)
    [NextWindowOnAllWorkspaces]  (Mod1-Control-Tab)
    [PrevWindow]  (Mod1-Shift-Tab)
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-1) {1}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-2) {2}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-3) {3}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-4) {4}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-5) {5}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-6) {6}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-7) {7}
    [changeWorkspace]  (Mod1-8) {8}

    [showRootMenu] (Mod1-Control-Escape)

    [Execute]  (Mod1-F5) {xrefresh}
    [Execute]  (Mod1-F1) {aterm -fn smoothansi -fg white -bg black -trsb -tr -sh 80 -tint steelblue -cr green -sl 5000}
  [end] (end keybindings)
[end] (end bbkeys configuration)

    As you can see, it's the same structure as blackbox's menu file.  All
    config options for bbkeys are kept in a [config] submenu structure, while all
    keybindings are kept in a [keybindings] submenu structure.  Inside the
    keybindings structure, the only other submenu structure is the [chain]
    directive.  It is important to note that both the config submenu
    structure and the keybindings submenu structure must have an [end] to
    delimit the section.  If it's not there, well, good luck. =:)
      
    
-[  Is it perfect? Absolutely not.  

    Will it core-dump all over your lap and puke on your blue suede 
    shoes? Hopefully not.  

    Are there bugs? Oh, you betcha.  

    Do I want to know about them there bugs? Yah, for sure.

    Are there things that I'm still planning to do? Ayup (that's what TODO is for).
