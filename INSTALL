To make and install this program :

run:
./configure (for configure options see ./configure --help)
make
make install (as root)

The global configuration files can be found in $(datadir)/bbtools 
(default: /usr/local/share/bbtools).

Blackbox users:

By default bbkeys reads the Blackbox style-file as defined in .blackboxrc 
and copies as much of the style as possible. The result is a application 
which looks a lot like the toolbar. Further configuration options can be 
found in bbkeys.style. Most likely you want to change these options, 
copy this file to somewhere in your homedir (eg blackbox/bbkeys.config) 
and edit it. Edit the file .blackboxrc and add or edit the line: 
bbkeys.configFile: <your config file>

WARNING: You have to define the entire PATH.

All style options set be reading the Blackbox-style file can be overridden by
placing them in bbkeys.config (and changing them). See bbkeys.style for all
possible options.

Make sure the file .bbtoolsrc does not exist, else the configuration style
for other Window Managers will be used.

Users of other Window managers:

By default bbkeys reads the bbtoolsrc bbkeys.nobb config files.
If you want to define your personal config-file copy bbtoolsrc to your home-dir
as ./.bbtoolsrc Copy bbkeys.nobb somewhere in your homedir. Edit .bbtoolsrc so
bbkeys.configFilex: <your config file>.

WARNING: You have to define the entire PATH.
