.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B bbkeys
[\fIOPTION\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbbkeys\fR is the keygrabber for the blackbox window manager. \fBbbkeys\fR
handles all keybindings and keyboard shortcuts for  blackbox. It uses
blackbox's Image classes for rendering its look and feel so that \fBbbkeys\fR
will render itself to match whatever blackbox style is used. It is highly
configurable either via the \fIbbconf\fR GUI utility or the (now deprecated)
\fIbbkeysconf\fR GUI utility or by hand\-editting bbkeys's config file.

.SH "USAGE"
On startup, \fBbbkeys\fR reads \fI$HOME/.bbkeysrc\fR, which you can edit by
hand or through \fIbbconf\fR or \fIbbkeysconf\fR. This is now configurable
through a command\-line switch as show in OPTIONS.
