@PACKAGE@
===============

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under MIT license @DATE@.

This package provides the classic @PACKAGE@d utility for setting key
bindings for GNOME/WMH and NetWM/EWMH compliant window managers that
do not provide a key binding mechanism of their own.

Release
-------

This is the `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` package, released @DATE@.  This
release, and the latest version, can be obtained from the [GitHub
repository][1], using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the [NEWS][2] file for release notes and history of user
visible changes for the current version, and the [ChangeLog][3]
file for a more detailed history of implementation changes.  The
[TODO][4] file lists features not yet implemented and other
outstanding items.

Please see the [INSTALL][5] file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)`, please use this file.  An abbreviated
installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

This release is published under MIT.  Please see the license in
the file [COPYING][6].


Quick Start
-----------

The quickest and easiest way to get `@PACKAGE@` up and running
is to run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install `@PACKAGE@` the quickest.
For those who would like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading
the output of `./configure --help`, some compile options can be
turned on and off before the build.

For general information on GNU's `./configure`, see the file
[INSTALL][5].
