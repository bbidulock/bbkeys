      - changed "friend blah" to "friend class blah" for gcc 3, etc. -

        potion, baybee.  We now have a cleaner build where we don't have to pass
          300 -DDEFINE's in our compile statement.  All modified source files
        were   to add an include for ../config.h to take advantage of this.
        Added files   were so we can do this deep magic.
      updating to 0.8.4 and trying to get multi-head working
      moving from C configurator which sucked to perl configurator which is MUCH

      cross-compilation patch from Bo Thorsen
      cleaning up ChangeLog
      fixing bitwise rather than logical or bug

      Initial revision
      bringing in bbkeys-ng
      trying this import again
      importing bbkeys-ng into bbkeys module
      apparently we need this too
      now looking for lib and headers separately
      setting multi_head to true by default for bt::Application
      trying to squash bug in updateClientList
      the beginnings of toggleDecorations.  half-broke currently and no time to
        fix it...
      toggleDecor working now
      waiting longer
      whoops -- chained grabs were borked, but now they're fixed
      okay, this now works with sawfish and ob2.  syncing and trying another
        attack
      window moving and updatedimensions cleanups
      blargh, syncpoint before tearing updateClientList apart
      - yay!!  hopefully squashed the SIGSEGV bug in ScreenHandler - implemented

        least doesn't die on HUP now)
      fixing support for wmaker
      passing move increments now, not position. also bringing in code from
        xwininfo for figuring out correct geometry
      fixing SIGCHLD problem
      intel compiler fix for nyz
      compile fixes for newest blackbox lib
      Initial revision
      new project started
      - fixing leftWorkspace bug - cleaning up files--auto-generated ones
        shouldn't be in CVS - putting kdevelop project file in
      auto-generated file buh bye
      bringing window list menu in, slowly
      working menu, yay!!
      small positioning fixes
      centering popup by default
      fixing signal handling
      cleaning up and fixing horiz/vert workspace movements

      removing debug statements
      fixing window-focus behavior at end of window cycling
      adding auto-config-checker timer, woot
      - popping window cycling menu if we only have one window
      fixing incorrect comment
      not cycling to windows that request to not be in skipped in a pager.  the
        problem was that we were trying to cycle to desktop-type windows, which
        isn't something that we should be doing, really.
      applying a variation of patch 939710--numlock patch
      i18n changes
      updating man pages for new version of bbkeys
      updated rc-file
      removing old c++builder file
      shipping with new default file now so we don't look ugly out of the box
      updating copyright
      version bump
      adding display of desktop name in window list if we're cycling windows
        outside of just the current desktop

        doesn't work   anyway
      - fixing raiseWhileCycling....  now, it works whether we are using the
        cycling menu or not
      logging reconfigure requests always now
      stupid debug line:
      - bumping to version 0.90beta3 in preparation for the next public release
        - adding configuration option for changing the cycle-menu title - this
        also has the effect of turning it off altogether if the string value
        parameter passed is empty
      adding ability to override menu justification
      - YAY!!!!  bbkeys now has toggleDecorations again!!  HUGE thanks to nyz
        for   the discussion this morning.  Matter of fact, I'm not sure why we
        ever   did the blackbox-specific atoms for decorations before, since
        this worked   so easily.  I tested it with blackbox and metacity and
        both work just   fine.  w00t!!  =:)
      updating man page for toggleDecorations
      - nyz's patches for changing netwm to emwh...
      - adding fix submitted by Petr Matousek and Sergey Vlasov... "I have made
        a   patch which adds clearing of all unneeded bits; with this   patch
        window cycling works even if a non-default XKB group is active."
      - committing code from Markus Ottenbacher for cleaned-up panel navigation
        - various and sundry other cleanups
      updating debian package build to new beta
      phew. debugging actions now
      bumping to version 0.9.0
      - rpm stuff coming in again
      should be done now.  rpm builds successfully, I think

eckzor <eckzor> (103):
      Addes the new windows style cycling. not quite perfect yet, but almost
        working right!
      cleaned up some code. made the menus close when anotehr event occurs, like
        switching desktops. menus no longer draw right, and i haven't a clue
        why.. :\ this is my job for otmorrow i suppose.
      reverting to before my last update. it was broken, and the changes are
        going to be irrelvant with newer additions to come
      changed up stack cycling to grab the entire keyboard, and moved the key
        handling for during stack cycling into stackmenu.cc
      took out the use of getHighlight() as it is not needed.
      reapplied the changes that were lost, and fixed the GrabKeyboard call
      nothing changed really. but this compiles now :)
      small fix
      fixed the button press routine to correctly grab the right event from the
        key stroke. almost all functional!
      test for ignoring shift
      stack cycling works! this fixed the KeyPress handling to make it go
        correctly
      changed the menu to not pop up with there are none or only 1 window that
        are going to be in the menu.
      bunch of changes to the menu code. no highlighting is going on at all
        atm.. soon to be fixed. and Escape will exit the menu now.
      stupid bug. stupid
      new Basemenu.*. woop! let the debugging begin..
      getting dots now.. sorta. and it compiles
      preliminary real highlighting
      moved little but bewtween basemenu and stackmenu
      sticky works! segfaults fixed! (hopefully all of them) iconfied windows
        work! TODO: make bbkeys not uniconfy when alt-tab is pressed TODO: add
        resources for changing how to cycle windows
      squashed a bug in removeSticky()
      fixed timer, cuz i broke it before in debugging. fixed Stackmenu::show()
        so that if 1 window is present, it sents the focus to it and leaves,
        instead of ignoring it.
      everything is working.. removed debugging messages. ill put em back in if
        i get a seggie somewheres along the way.
      added a resource for switching between linear and stacked window cycling.
      added the new resource to the config files for window cycling styles
      moved the resource loading to a more appropriate place
      added my name to the top of the files i made large changes on and didnt
        have my name in.
      hopefully fix a core dump in setMenuItems()
      got rid of the compiler warning the the debugging function p(). i think
        i've made it possible to do a "show windows on all workspaces" option. I
        don't want to try code that from work tho.. so I will look into that
        later. if the cycling order stops being correct this can be removed
        again, it consists of removing the check in focus_stack, to not focus a
        window on a desktop other than the current one.
      chaged the menu's reconfigureing and how items are added.
      fix alt relaese change the checks in setMenuItems for the Xlib calls
      readded old checks to setMenuItems as well for extra caution
      fix nonappearing menu?
      moved a couple things into show() from bbkeys::cycle_stack() removed a
        couple commented out lines
      fix the checks on the Xlib calls in setMenuItems to watch for success, not
        failure. oops.
      got rid of thew Update in stackmenu, as it was a completely useless waste
        of cpu power
      fixed Basemenu hopefully to play nice when using setHighlight and the
        mouse in tandom to select menu items. This is done by calling
        setHighlight, with what i think is the selected item, in motionNotify in
        Basemenu.cc
      hardcode "Return" key to select the current menu item and use it. break
        out the selecting the currently focused menu item and acting on it into
        seperate function, selectFocused()
      other keybndings dont close the menu now
      add where state will be staved for keypressing/releasing in the menu
      new menu keyreleasing code! hoe this works
      redone the catching key releases for closing the menu.
      fully working keyRelease for the menu now. a faster method should be
        implemented though.
      cleaned up keypress in bbkeys.cc process_events
      this has a new method for keyRelease, and adds teh actionList memver
        variable to ToolWindow, which is a reference from a given action, to the
        entry for that action in grabSet.
      added a few checks in releaseKey, and reset the actionList variable when
        keygrabs are loaded.
      fixed login in keyRelease:
      added the "showAllWorkspaces" option. I've tested it a little, hope it
        works right!
      some fixes for focusing windows with stickyness around. fixed showAll to
        work right with sticky windows as well as normal stacked again.
      changed addSticky(). maybe this will get rid of the bug.
      fixed the bug with windows being turned sticky from desktops other than
        where they were originally on.
      fixed compilation with the past commit. *oops*
      when "showAllWorkspaces" is on, the window list for stacked cycling
        appends "(workspace 1)" to each window in the list (with the correct
        number). Also squashed a bug where the first time the menu was brought
        up after starting bbkeys, it would not center properly.
      patched in the code to have a matrix like workspace setup, and have bbkeys
        switch between them.
      this keeps the menu on top of all other windows. if another app ends up
        doing the same thing as this..there will be problems, as we accomplish
        this by catching XEvents that tell us we're hiden, and raising ourselves
        back to the top. We only do this becuase blackbox does not provide us a
        way to keep the menu always on top as best as we can find. When a better
        solution is available, this will be switched over to it.
      added a couple things to the TODO
      changed the convert function so that Meta_[LR] look for the Mod4Mask, as
        this is how it would be on a 104 key keyboard, i believe. In xev, i get
        state of 0x40, which is 1<<6, which is Mod4Mask for the Meta_L key.
      this change supposedly fixes a siggie. deals with a bug in X.
      got rid of a useless variables. added the XK_Super_[LR] keys to be
        associated with the Mod3Mask.
      fixed the description in debian/control
      changed my email addres everywhere (except in the Changelog)
      added a -rc[file] command line parameter to the perl script, and so it can
        now have it's rcfile specified at the command line.
      Added a -h[elp] option.
      fix iconify last window on workspace -- maximixe bug that makes blackbox
        seggie. When a window is removed, if it was the focus window, the focus
        window is changed to 0 (None).
      added a description of my last patch. the sanity check in removeWindow()
      set the DISPLAY environment variable for exec's commands when tehy are run
        so they run on the correct head.
      using string instead of ostrstream. more portable. set the DISPLAY env var
        when execing a command so they run on the right display.
      use vr's fix for setenv =)
      make bbkeys stop trying to perform action
      "Need to take out this next bit when nyz has 0.60.0 ready"
      last focus_window cleanups, and some braces cleanups =)
      fix (hopefully) all the solaris compiling issues.
      include stdlib for the setenv call
      use putenv instead of setenv, solaris doesnt seem to have setenv.
      update auto* system to work on solaris now too?
      oops, removed something
      regenerated files
      some header dependancy cleanups
      header dependancy cleanups
      more solaris fixes
      set up linker flags specifically for the solaris platform so that we
        compile.
      these files are needed to get the system host type
      readding files
      properly get the host system type
      readding files
      reorder
      properly grab the host os
      even more correctly get the host!
      even better solaris support? no more -g all teh time when compiling, etc
      get rid of a syntax error
      update with changes ive made for the last few days
      better linked list removal
      when we are notified that blackbox is starting, clear out our windows
        list, in case we have any rogues from the last shutdown.
      add entry for change where window list is cleared when a blackbox startup
        message is received.
      remove the X server grabs. They actually can cause the server to lock
        indefinately, and they are not needed.
      fix a memory leak
      change how the window's position is retreived for window nudging. The old
        code relied ona  bug in blackbox, which has been fixed. So now we have
        to do this right.
      add some debug printfs
      to get the window's decorations sizes, we have to compare to the window's
        parent's parent
      properly acquire window margins and positions, so that nudging works
        properly
      back out changes to window nudging. they are no longer required.
      possible fix for the mouse-over-the-menu focus problem
      proper window nudging at last.
      remove some debugging printfs

        don't want to try code that from work tho.. so I will look into that
        later. if the cycling order stops being correct this can be removed
        again, it consists of removing the check in focus_stack, to not focus a
        window on a desktop other than the current one.
      chaged the menu's reconfigureing and how items are added.
      fix alt relaese change the checks in setMenuItems for the Xlib calls
      readded old checks to setMenuItems as well for extra caution
      fix nonappearing menu?
      moved a couple things into show() from bbkeys::cycle_stack() removed a
        couple commented out lines
      fix the checks on the Xlib calls in setMenuItems to watch for success, not
        failure. oops.
      got rid of thew Update in stackmenu, as it was a completely useless waste
        of cpu power
      fixed Basemenu hopefully to play nice when using setHighlight and the
        mouse in tandom to select menu items. This is done by calling
        setHighlight, with what i think is the selected item, in motionNotify in
        Basemenu.cc
      hardcode "Return" key to select the current menu item and use it. break
        out the selecting the currently focused menu item and acting on it into
        seperate function, selectFocused()
      other keybndings dont close the menu now
      add where state will be staved for keypressing/releasing in the menu
      new menu keyreleasing code! hoe this works
      redone the catching key releases for closing the menu.
      fully working keyRelease for the menu now. a faster method should be
        implemented though.
      cleaned up keypress in bbkeys.cc process_events
      this has a new method for keyRelease, and adds teh actionList memver
        variable to ToolWindow, which is a reference from a given action, to the
        entry for that action in grabSet.
      added a few checks in releaseKey, and reset the actionList variable when
        keygrabs are loaded.
      fixed login in keyRelease:
      added the "showAllWorkspaces" option. I've tested it a little, hope it
        works right!
      some fixes for focusing windows with stickyness around. fixed showAll to
        work right with sticky windows as well as normal stacked again.
      changed addSticky(). maybe this will get rid of the bug.
      fixed the bug with windows being turned sticky from desktops other than
        where they were originally on.
      fixed compilation with the past commit. *oops*
      when "showAllWorkspaces" is on, the window list for stacked cycling
        appends "(workspace 1)" to each window in the list (with the correct
        number). Also squashed a bug where the first time the menu was brought
        up after starting bbkeys, it would not center properly.
      patched in the code to have a matrix like workspace setup, and have bbkeys
        switch between them.
      this keeps the menu on top of all other windows. if another app ends up
        doing the same thing as this..there will be problems, as we accomplish
        this by catching XEvents that tell us we're hiden, and raising ourselves
        back to the top. We only do this becuase blackbox does not provide us a
        way to keep the menu always on top as best as we can find. When a better
        solution is available, this will be switched over to it.
      added a couple things to the TODO
      changed the convert function so that Meta_[LR] look for the Mod4Mask, as
        this is how it would be on a 104 key keyboard, i believe. In xev, i get
        state of 0x40, which is 1<<6, which is Mod4Mask for the Meta_L key.
      this change supposedly fixes a siggie. deals with a bug in X.
      got rid of a useless variables. added the XK_Super_[LR] keys to be
        associated with the Mod3Mask.
      fixed the description in debian/control
      changed my email addres everywhere (except in the Changelog)
      added a -rc[file] command line parameter to the perl script, and so it can
        now have it's rcfile specified at the command line.
      Added a -h[elp] option.
      fix iconify last window on workspace -- maximixe bug that makes blackbox
        seggie. When a window is removed, if it was the focus window, the focus
        window is changed to 0 (None).
      added a description of my last patch. the sanity check in removeWindow()
      set the DISPLAY environment variable for exec's commands when tehy are run
        so they run on the correct head.
      using string instead of ostrstream. more portable. set the DISPLAY env var
        when execing a command so they run on the right display.
      use vr's fix for setenv =)
      make bbkeys stop trying to perform action
      "Need to take out this next bit when nyz has 0.60.0 ready"
      last focus_window cleanups, and some braces cleanups =)
      fix (hopefully) all the solaris compiling issues.
      include stdlib for the setenv call
      use putenv instead of setenv, solaris doesnt seem to have setenv.
      update auto* system to work on solaris now too?
      oops, removed something
      regenerated files
      some header dependancy cleanups
      header dependancy cleanups
      more solaris fixes
      set up linker flags specifically for the solaris platform so that we
        compile.

      readding files
      properly get the host system type

      get rid of a syntax error
      update with changes ive made for the last few days
      better linked list removal
      when we are notified that blackbox is starting, clear out our windows
        list, in case we have any rogues from the last shutdown.
      add entry for change where window list is cleared when a blackbox startup
        message is received.
      remove the X server grabs. They actually can cause the server to lock
        indefinately, and they are not needed.
      fix a memory leak
      change how the window's position is retreived for window nudging. The old
        code relied ona  bug in blackbox, which has been fixed. So now we have
        to do this right.
      add some debug printfs
      to get the window's decorations sizes, we have to compare to the window's
        parent's parent
      properly acquire window margins and positions, so that nudging works
        properly
      back out changes to window nudging. they are no longer required.
      possible fix for the mouse-over-the-menu focus problem
      proper window nudging at last.
      remove some debugging printfs
