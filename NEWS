- Make use of this file. :) Stuff like the note from 2001-08-03 should
  really be in here, so it moved. README will contain non-INSTALL-related
  usage instructions.

2001-08-03...

- This hasn't been updated in a LOOONG time, so I'll do so now.  Some
  exciting new features have been added to bbkeys with this release
  (0.8.0), and I'll try to explain one of them here.  By default, bbkeys
  will now window-cycle MUCH better.  Of course, all keybindings are
  user-configurable as before, and whatever keys you were using before for
  PrevWindow/NextWindow will still work--they'll just work better.

  xOr has helped me considerably (HUGE THANKS AGAIN, xOr!!) with this
  release, and one of the new features that we added was a "stackedCycling"
  methodology to window-switching.  To turn off this incredibly GOOD
  feature (although I have NO idea why you would want to), put this in your
  bbtools/bbkeys config file (no, not ~/.bbkeysrc--this is the other one
  that's by default looked for at ~/.bbtools/bbkeys.bb or
  ~/.bbtools/bbkeys.nobb)....

  ! set this to false to use the linear style of window cycling
  bbkeys.menu.stackedCycling:	False

  Again, why you'd want to do that is beyond me, because there's SO much
  more benefit to letting bbkeys do things the way it wants to--the new
  way.  But if you're absolutely dead-set against progress, then put that
  in.  What you'll then be using is another improvement--a "linear" cycling
  method.  This will look the same as the old blackbox/bbkeys window
  cycling method, but will act a little bit better and make more sense.  It
  will, for instance, put a newly-created window into the cycling stack
  immediately after the currently-focused window, so you just have to
  "alt+tab" to it, rather than having to go all the way around the stack.

  As for the new method for cycling windows...  When you hit your
  NextWindow keybinding (mine's <alt+tab>), a window menu will pop up and
  stay up until you release your PrevWindow/NextWindow keys.  This allows you 
  to navigate through the window list (only showing the windows on the current
  workspace, but INCLUDING STICKY WINDOWS!!), and then release your keys
  when you have the window hilighted that you want to switch to.  You can
  go backwards or forwards through the list, by using your NextWindow and
  PrevWindow keys.  You can also make the pop-up window menu go away by
  hitting <Escape>, or if you want, you can select the window currently
  hilighted with <Return> or <Enter>.  What this last little feature also
  means is that if you have only one key bound to PrevWindow or NextWindow
  (i.e. using F11 to cycle forwards and F12 to cycle backwards), you can
  keep cycling backwards/forwards, and then when you've hilighted the
  window you want, just hit <Return>, or <Escape> to cancel.

  But that's not all!!  With this new cycling scheme, the window list stack
  will be re-organized when you cycle to a new/different window.  The
  window that you had previously focused is now right below the one you now
  have focused.  So you can switch back and forth between windows with a
  simple <alt+tab> (or whatever you choose for your NextWindow keybinding.

  I guess that's about it.  Give it a try.  I think you'll be pleasantly
  suprised.
