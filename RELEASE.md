Maintenance Release 0.9.2
=========================

This is another release of the bbkeys package that provides the classic
bbkeys utility for setting key bindings for GNOME/WMH and NetWM/EWMH
compliant window managers that do not provide a key binding mechanism of
their own.

This release is a maintenance release whose sole purpose is to update
the build system, generate a better NEWS file, handle annotated tags
better, and convert the release archives to lzip compression.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/bbkeys/issues).
